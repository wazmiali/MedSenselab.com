### ðŸ§« MedSenseLab.com (IIT Jammu) â€” Proposed Project Description

**MedSenseLab.com** is envisioned as the digital hub and showcase platform for the Medical Sensing Laboratory at IIT Jammu. Here's a refined description that could fit the project:

---

**MedSenseLab.com** is the official portal for the Medical Sensing Laboratory at the Indian Institute of Technology Jammu. The site serves as:

* **A showcase of cutting-edge research** in biomedical sensing and diagnostics, demonstrating innovations in wearable sensors, pointâ€‘ofâ€‘care devices, and AIâ€‘driven health analytics.
* **An academic and collaboration beacon**, highlighting lab members (faculty, researchers, students), their expertise, publications, and ongoing projects.
* **An interactive platform for outreach**, facilitating conference/event announcements, news about awards or grants, and establishing contact points for academia and industry partnerships.
* **A resource center** with downloadable datasets, demos of lab-pioneered sensing algorithms, and open-source components aimed at advancing medical diagnostics research.

By combining rigorous academic output with practical demonstration and engagement tools, MedSenseLab.com reinforces IIT Jammuâ€™s mission of translational research in healthcare technologies.

**Typical sections** one would expect on the site:

* **Home** â€“ Overview of labâ€™s mission and impact
* **People** â€“ Profiles of PIs, postdocs, PhD/graduate students
* **Research** â€“ Summaries of projects (e.g., wearable pulse oximetry, nonâ€‘invasive glucose sensing)
* **Publications** â€“ Papers and conference proceedings
* **Events** â€“ Notices about seminars, workshops, hackathons
* **News** â€“ Highlights like lab milestones, grants, and media coverage
* **Contact** â€“ Inquiry form or contact details for collaborations
